Project Description
================================

Coordinated the execution of a full-cycle online/mobile contest on a short deadline and restricted budget for Rogers Chatr Wireless customers. The online portion of the contest allowed Rogers Chatr wireless customers to enter a valid Chatr phone number to participate in the contest and possibly win prizes. They would receive text messages if they won a prize or receive a number to enter into the web site.
